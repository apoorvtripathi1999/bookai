The hotel had an incredible view of the ocean, and the rooms were spacious and beautifully decorated. The staff was exceptionally kind and went out of their way to make my stay comfortable. However, the food at the restaurant was a major letdownâ€”it was overpriced and lacked flavor. To make matters worse, the Wi-Fi was extremely slow, which made it difficult to get any work done. Despite these issues, the overall experience was enjoyable, and I would consider visiting again.
